# Psychic Game!

```bash
Start the game by clicking on the 'Lets Begin!' button
This is a basic JavaScript game that lets the user try guess a letter of the alphabet a max of 10 times. If the user does not guess the correct letter within those 10 tries the user gets a loss point. If guess correctly the user gets a win point. 

The user can reset the game by quitting.
